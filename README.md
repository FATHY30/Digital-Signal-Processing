# Digital-Signal-Processing
• Signal processing features: These include adding, subtracting, multiplying, squaring, shifting, normalizing, accumulating, 
smoothing, delaying, and advancing signals.  
• Frequency domain transforms: These include the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the discrete cosine transform 
(DCT).  
• Image processing features: These include removing the DC component from an image, smoothing the image, convolving 
the image with a filter, sharpening the image, delaying, and advancing the image, folding the image, and calculating the 
normalized cross-correlation between two images.  
• Template matching: This feature allows the app to find a specific template image within a larger image.  
• Fast convolution and correlation: These features allow the app to perform convolution and correlation calculations 
quickly
